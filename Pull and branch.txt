Pull and branch::



By default repo is on a master branch .If u wants to make some another branch than u can make it following those steps : 
1. Make it manually :
	Goto your github repository  + click the master named button 

Then add a new branch name on the search bar and it added as a new branch name;

2. Make it using command line : 
Goto to visualcode editor and enter the terminal box and write : 
   
Git checkout branch_name (if there is an existing another branch )
Git checkout -b branch_name (create a new brach)


    DONE!!!!, No, 

You just create a new branch  and then push to on github .. but wait ?
U create a branch locally and it is not existed on your github account.

To add your crated branch on your github account typer it : 


Git push --set-upstream origin master brach_name




To marge those with master branch then marge it to go marge option to clicking “view all brach ”(under the all branch name )
And then marge it  :)

** to staring coding first do “git pul” to find a data and branch access
** To show all branch name : git branch --a
** To show current branch name :  git branch
